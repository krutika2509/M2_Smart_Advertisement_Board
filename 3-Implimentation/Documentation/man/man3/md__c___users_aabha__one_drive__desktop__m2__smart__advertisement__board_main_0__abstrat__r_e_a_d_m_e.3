In this project, I have created a smart advertising board that will get electrictiy form the solar panel and will store it in the battery banks\&. At night battry packs will take paower from the battery pack and it will help to glow the main head led strip and also the atmega328\&. By doing this porject we can make use of solar power in terms of advertising as well, From a long time i have seen that either big tv's or even large gigantic banners are used for the purpose of advertisement and in a nutshell i can say that it will consume more power as compared to my project\&. But it all changes with my project with my project we can use solar power and simple foled banners to do the advertisement\&. Which can attract the audience by its audio and will be very less in terms of the energy consumption as well\&. Smart_Advertisement_Board can have as many advertisement as we like and depending on the size of the board used for the same\&. It can be easyly used by the govt and the private sectors to advertise theself without breaking the bank\&.

As we know simulide dont have solar panel powered battries so for the sole purpose of successfull simulation we have assumed that as a voltage source\&. We also know that ATmega 328 in simulide has predefined VCC and GND conection so we have not supplied any votage source in that\&.
