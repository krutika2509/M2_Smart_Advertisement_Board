Advertising has three primary objectives: to inform, to persuade, and to remind. Informative Advertising creates awareness of brands, products, services, and ideas.

## Components and Software required
1.[Atmega28p](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/atmega328p-pn/microchip-technology) - A single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family

2.[SimulIDE](https://www.simulide.com/p/home.html) -  A simple real time electronic circuit simulator

3.[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications

4.[LED]() - A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it

5.[Atmel Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio) - The Atmel Studio 7 IDP gives you a seamless and easy-to-use environment to write, build, and debug your applications written in C/C++ or assembly code. It also connects seamlessly to the debuggers, programmers, and development kits that support AVR.

6.[DC Motor]() - A DC motor is any of a class of rotary electrical motors that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy. 

## Applications
1.Billboard advertisements are designed to catch a person's attention and create a memorable impression very quickly, leaving the reader thinking about the advertisement after they have driven past it. They have to be readable in a very short time because they are usually read while being passed at high speeds. 

2.The advertising design is the artwork that is visual and created for advertisements specifically. Graphic design has become synonymous with the world of advertising, and visual representations of products and services are essential for any brand to get its message across to the public

3.Can be placed anyware Advertising billboards are placed strategically along major thoroughfares and highways, thus, increasing the possibilities of being seen by a great number of consumers all throughout the day.

4.Access to Targeted Audience since billboards can be placed in areas chosen by advertisers or companies, it will be easier for these companies to reach a particular or specific consumer group they sell their services and products to
